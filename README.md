# dsa2-majorassignment


Data Structures and Algorithms This project includes 12 different problems solved in C++. Topics; Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Divide and Conquer

problems:

problem 1 greedy algorithm
problem 2 greedy algorithm
problem 3 repeat previous problem 2 using dynamic programming
problem 4 greedy algorithm
problem 5 Same problem 4 but using dynamic programming
problem 6 backtracking
problem 7 backtracking
problem 8 backtracking
problem 9 backtracking
problem 10 divide and conquer
problem 11 divide and conquer
problem 12 divide and conquer


Clone the project: git clone https://github.com/sudeterkan/dsa2-majorassignment.git
Install the C++ compiler (for example, g++), the C++ compiler environment (for example, GCC), and the necessary dependencies required for the compilation process.
Operating Instructions

There is a separate C++ file for each problem. At the beginning of each file are instructions for solving a specific problem.

Follow these steps to resolve any problems:

Open the relevant C++ file.
Compile the file: g++ Problem 1 Greedy Algorithm.cpp -o Problem1GreedyAlgorithm.
Run the resulting executable: ./Problem1GreedyAlgorithm
