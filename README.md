Setup

Clone the project: git clone 
Install the C++ compiler (for example, g++), the C++ compiler environment (for example, GCC), and the necessary dependencies required for the compilation process.
Operating Instructions

There is a separate C++ file for each problem. At the beginning of each file are instructions for solving a specific problem.

Follow these steps to resolve any problems:

Open the relevant C++ file.
Compile the file: g++ Problem 1 Greedy Algorithm.cpp -o Problem1GreedyAlgorithm.
Run the resulting executable: ./Problem1GreedyAlgorithm
